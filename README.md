📌 Project Summary

This project demonstrates the implementation and troubleshooting of a complete Active Directory infrastructure lab using Windows Server.

The lab focuses on understanding how DNS and DHCP integrate with Active Directory, and how configuration errors can directly impact domain operations.

This was built and tested in a virtual lab environment (VMware Workstation).
